# Shell scripts

Some shell scrips I've written. Mostly in Bash. Some are simple and meant to be run by some other program.

## Descriptions

- backup - A local backup script using Borg backup.
- post-install - Linux desktop post installation script.
- timer - Countdown timer that can take many time formats and shows countdown progress.
[Based on this scripts.](https://github.com/lzh9102/bash-countdown) Bash is not ideal for rather long and complex scripts such as this but it was little hobby project.
- set-mouse-buttons.sh - Little start-up script for desktop Linux with X.org to set mouse
buttons.
- other smaller ones.
